# TRIJAM-2
For the Langley game dev team
Finished i made a finished version of it
It was made before your visual changes so im sorry that it does'nt incorprate it. I think we need to find better ways to work with github since the change corrupted my old folder directly after building for windows before i was able to build for WEBGL
I might be too busy to work on it anymore, ill insert the zip in a seperate branch
